My name is Thushar Ishwanthlal.

I am a Third Year Student at the University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics, Currently Undecided in Major. Certain courses that make up my studies include Combinatorics and Optimization, Game Theory, Econometrics and Differential Equations.

When I am not working on my schoolwork, I spend my time coding, usually in the form of creating games. The languages that I am familiar with are Python (Pandas and Tensorflow mainly), R, Java, C++ and most predominantly C# within Unity's Engine.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a few projects, including communicating between CSV's and Unity, Making simple concepts for game ideas that I have and abstracting the process of creating the tools I need to make games.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently expanding my knowledge of the features within Unity (such as NavMeshAgent's and the Animation Interface). Outside of unity, I am also learing the basics of Artificial Intelligence.

- ðŸ“« The easiest way to reach me would be through email: thushar.ishwanthlal@gmail.com
